# 100-days-of-webdev

*somewhere between learning and re-learning*

it's going to be interesting an journey. my current workplace requires me to write lots of php and jQuery. but i am curious about all the hyped up tech, libraries, and frameworks.

starting from today, June 12. 2024.
my approach is going to be simple. get familiar with the library/framework. think of a small project. build it. and gradually increase the complexity of the projects. i am not solidifying what i will learn, and what i won't. i am keeping this journey as interesting and as flexible as it can be, because it's a fun lil challenge. learning is the primary goal. also, dealing with the fomo of all the latest and hyped up framework and libraries too.

good luck to me! let's see how far i can go.

### technologies, libraries, or frameworks, i learned or worked with, during these 100 days.
